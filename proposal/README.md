#Capstone Project Proposal
In this capstone project proposal, prior to completing the following Capstone Project, you you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to author a proposal for solving a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. A project proposal encompasses seven key points:

The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
A solution statement — a the solution proposed for the problem given;
A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
Think about a technical field or domain that you are passionate about, such as robotics, virtual reality, finance, natural language processing, or even artificial intelligence (the possibilities are endless!). Then, choose an existing problem within that domain that you are interested in which you could solve by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. Be sure that you have collected all of the resources needed (such as datasets, inputs, and research) to complete this project, and make the appropriate citations wherever necessary in your proposal. Below are a few suggested problem areas you could explore if you are unsure what your passion is:

Robot Motion Planning
Healthcare
Computer Vision
Education
Investment and Trading
In addition, you may find a technical domain (along with the problem and dataset) as competitions on platforms such as Kaggle, or Devpost. This can be helpful for discovering a particular problem you may be interested in solving as an alternative to the suggested problem areas above. In many cases, some of the requirements for the capstone proposal are already defined for you when choosing from these platforms.
